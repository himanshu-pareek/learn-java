Some rules:

1. Don't provide "setter" methods.
2. Make all fields final and private.
3. Don't allow subclasses to override methods.
  A. Simplest way - Declare class as final
  B. More sofisticated way - private constructor & factory methods to create instances
4. If the instance fields include reference to mutable objects, don't allow those objects to be changes:
  4.1. Don't provide methods that modify the mutable objects
  4.2. Don't share references to the mutable objects
