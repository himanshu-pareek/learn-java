# Executors

In large applications, it makes sense to seperate thread-management and creation from the rest of the application. Objects that encapsulate these functions are known as **Executors**.

- Executor Interfaces define 3 executor object types.
- Thread Pools are the most common type of executor implementation.
- Fork/Join is a framework for taking advantage of multiple processors.
